# CERG @ Illinois Website

This is the repository that will eventually house the source code for the [UIUC Contextual Engineering Research Group website](https://contextual.engineering.illinois.edu/), which uses the (Frontity)[https://frontity.org/] framework to use the WordPress CMS for retrieving content and React to design a web application. As of 4/26/2022, the project is heavily in-progress with two primary development "groups": `frontity-migration` and `pure-react`.

`frontity-migration` houses the deployment testing for the eventual migration of the designs from `pure-react`. `pure-react` houses the primary front-end implementations with hard-coded content. This "separation of concerns" enables simultaenous progress in both deploying and creating the site. 

This is a solo volunteer project. PRs are welcome, but as of now, there's probably not much public material to work off of.
