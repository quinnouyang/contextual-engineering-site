# Contextual Engineering @ Illinois [DEPRECATED]

> :warning: This website is no longer under active maintenance or use, in favor of an internal CMS + front-end system that someone else developed.

Source code of the website for the [Contextual Engineering Research Group](https://contextual.engineering.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/): an assembly of university students and researchers who investigate and develop methods for sustainable engineering in diverse communities.

> Built with [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/), and haphazard Googling.

This is a largely solo volunteer project. Contact qouyang3@illinois.edu for questions.

Thank you to [UIUC CPanel](https://web.illinois.edu/), Ann Witmer, @jacobah3, and [everyone else at CERG](https://contextual.engineering.illinois.edu/people)â€“this would have not seen the light of day without you all!
